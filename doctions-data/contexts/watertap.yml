      - Reorganized repository to prepare the merger of WaterTAP3 model and data
      - Added zero-order base class models that will form the basis of most WaterTAP3 models
      - Updated all chemistry tests to use new IDAES log formulations Updated the electrolyte database (EDB) EDB by removing out of date information, leveraging MongoDB, and allowing users to control the output and customize the reaction order
      - Added tests demonstrating the precipitation in equilibrium processes including remineralization, water softening, phosphorous removal
      - Added more documentation on the EDB
      - Updated zero-order nanofiltration model to be compatible with the IDAES generic property package
